# ReactJS / TypeScript Weather API 🌦️

## Description

<p>A simple weather app coded with ReactJS, TypeScript and styled with TailwindCSS. Also I use fetch to manipulate data from an API. Aditionally, the search field listens to the user's input and makes an API call to get a suggestion of top locations the user might be looking for. Once the user submits the search we will make another api call and get the user the weather data 🪄.</p>
